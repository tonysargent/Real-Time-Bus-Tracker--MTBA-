# Real Time Bus Tracker (MTBA)
MIT xPro Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise
Tracks a Boston bus route in real time with a map marker using mapbox.
This utilises the MTBA api to retrieve the bus data and javascript to create the moving marker on the map.

Instructions:
When open in the browser press the "Track Bus Location" button to add a marker to the map that updates the bus location every 10 seconds.
At this stage the application shows one singular route, however could be updated to view multiple bus routes at once or toggle through different bus routes in Boston for future development.
